                    <p>The site designed to meet your needs. Here at Weightrack we recognise that everyone is on their own journey to greatness. We have all seen the youtube videos of buff guys telling you exactly what you need to do to get ripped or bulk up. The problem is this: Those sort of videos expect 2 things from you:</p>
                    <p> 1 - That your bank balance has six digits</p>
                    <p>2 - You are able to get to a gym at anytime of any day to suit the training program</p>
                    <p>This site makes no such assumptions. It is built by people just like yourself from a diverse range of backgrounds.</p>
                    <p></p>
